## Design Patterns in CPP
I am learning software design patterns, and I am using YouTube videos to learn them. [Derek Banas](https://www.youtube.com/@derekbanas) is the main channel that I use to learn, but since he does his videos in Java, I am going to implement them in C++ for practice (also, I love C++).
